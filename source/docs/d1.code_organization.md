title: Code Organization
---

When a single code block is getting larger, it should be decomposed into smaller pieces and should be organized in a proper manner. Rust supports different levels of code organization.

1. ### [Functions](d2.functions.html)
2. ### [Modules](d3.modules.html)

  Can be mapped to a,
  
  - **Inline module**
  - **File** 
  - **Directory hierarchy**
  
3. ### [Crates](d4.crates.html)

  Can be mapped to a, 
  - **lib.rs file on the same executable crate**
  - **Dependency crate specified on Cargo.toml**
    
    Can be specified from,
    
    - **path**
    - **git repository**
    - **crates.io**
    
4. ### [Workspaces](d5.workspaces.html)

  Helps to manage multiple crates as a single project.


Let’s discuss one by one.

> 💡 To make examples more simpler, we use a simple function which prints `“Hello, world!”`. But regarding writing testable codes, always try to return the `String` from the function and print it when calling it, instead printing the String inside the function.
