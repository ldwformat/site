title: Cargo, Crates and Basic Project Structure
---

## Cargo

Cargo is Rustâ€™s built-in package manager and the build system. It can be used to,

- Create a new project: `cargo new`
- Build the project: `cargo build`
- Run the project: `cargo run`  
- Update project dependencies: `cargo update`
- Run tests: `cargo test`  
- Generate the project documentation via [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustdoc/): `cargo doc`
- Analyze the project to see it has any errors, without building it: `cargo check`

In addition, there are `cargo` commands to publish the project as a crate/ package to **Rust's official crate registry, [crates.io](https://crates.io/)**.

> ðŸ’¡ We need to get an API token from [crates.io](https://crates.io/) to publish a crate to it. The API token can be found in the [Account Settings page](https://crates.io/me), after login to that site. We will discuss more about this under [code organization with crates](https://learning-rust.github.io/docs/d4.crates.html#c-Using-crates-io).

- Log in to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) with the API token: `cargo login`
- Make the local crate uploadable to [crates.io](https://crates.io/): `cargo package`
- Upload the crate to [crates.io](https://crates.io/): `cargo publish`

## Crate

A crate is a package, which can be shared via [crates.io](https://crates.io/). A crate can produce an executable or a library. In other words, it can be a **binary** crate or a **library** crate.

01. `cargo new crate_name --bin` or `cargo new crate_name`: Produces an executable
02. `cargo new crate_name --lib`: Produces a library

The first one generates,

```
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ main.rs
```

and the second one generates,

```
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
```

* **Cargo.toml**\(capital c\) is the configuration file which contains all of the metadata that Cargo needs to compile your project.
* **src** folder is the place to store the source code.
* Each crate has an implicit crate root/ entry point. **main.rs** is the crate root for a binary crate and **lib.rs** is the crate root for a library crate.

> ðŸ’¡ When we build a binary crate via `cargo build` or `cargo run`, the executable file will be stored in **target/debug/** folder. But when building it via `cargo build --release` for a release it will be stored in **target/release/** folder.

## Project Structure

This is how [Cargo Docs describes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html) about the recommended project layout,

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ benches
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ large-input.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ examples
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ simple.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bin
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ another_executable.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs
â””â”€â”€ tests
    â””â”€â”€ some-integration-tests.rs
```

- The source code goes in the `src` directory.  
- The default library file is `src/lib.rs`.  
- The default executable file is `src/main.rs`.  
- Other executables can be placed in `src/bin/*.rs`.  
- Integration tests go in the `tests` directory \(unit tests go in each file they're testing\).  
- Examples go in the `examples` directory.  
- Benchmarks go in the `benches` directory.
