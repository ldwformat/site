title: 代码注释与文档
---

## 注释

```rust
// 单行注释
/* 块注释
```

同时也支持嵌套的块注释

💡 **通常来说，会尽量避免使用块注释，而采用多个行注释。**

## 文档注释

```rust
/// Line comments; document the next item
/** Block comments; document the next item */

//! Line comments; document the enclosing item
/*! Block comments; document the enclosing item !*/
```

Doc comments support Markdown notations. Using `cargo doc`, the HTML documentation can be generated from these doc comments. Let’s see the difference between the two sets of doc comments.

```rust
/// This module contains tests
mod test {
    // ...
}


mod test {
    //! This module contains tests

    // ...
}
```

As you can see both use to document the same module. The first comment has been added before the module while the second one has been added inside the module.

💡 **Only use //! to write crate and module-level documentation, nothing else. When using `mod` blocks, use /// outside of the block.**

## Doc Attributes

We can also use **doc attributes** for documenting the code.

> 🔎 An [attribute](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#attributes) is a general, free-form **metadatum** that is interpreted according to the name, convention, language and compiler version. Any item declaration may have an attribute applied to it.

Here, for instance, each comment is equivalent to relevant data attributes.

```rust
/// Foo
#[doc="Foo"]

//! Foo
#![doc="Foo"]
```
